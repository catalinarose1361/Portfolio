        <p> Thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to view my portfolio! My name is Catalina Williams, I'm a Colorado Native with a passion for Website Development.

            Before embarking on my journey into the technical industry, I was studying Anthropology at the University of Colorado Denver. My career path took me in a different direction, however Archeaology and Pre-History continue to inspire me.
            
            Something that makes me a wonderful website developer is my ability to view a concept from many perspectives and viewpoints. Through that inspiration I've had the opportuity to travel to over 20 different countries! Other interests of mine include wildlife activism, politics, and gardening. Thanks again for reading! -Catalina
